The complete training procedure including pre-training is described by Algorithm 2. 4 RELATED WORK In other recent RL-inspired work on sequence prediction, Ranzato et al. (2015) trained a translation model by gradually transitioning from maximum likelihood learning into optimizing BLEU or ROUGE scores using the REINFORCE algorithm. However, REINFORCE is known to have very high variance and does not exploit the availability of the ground-truth like the critic network does. The approach also relies on a curriculum learning scheme. Standard value-based RL algorithms like SARSA and OLPOMDP have also been applied to structured prediction (Maes et al., 2009). Again, these systems do not use the ground-truth for value prediction. Imitation learning has also been applied to structured prediction (Vlachos, 2012). Methods of this type include the SEARN (DaumÂ e Iii et al., 2009) and DAGGER (Ross et al., 2010) algorithms. These methods rely on an expert policy to provide action sequences that the policy learns to imitate. Unfortunately, itâ s not always easy or even possible to construct an expert policy for a task-speciï c score. In our approach, the critic plays a role that is similar to the expert policy, but is learned without requiring prior knowledge about the task-speciï c score. The recently proposed â scheduled samplingâ (Bengio et al., 2015) can also be seen as imitation learning. In this method, ground-truth tokens are occasionally replaced by samples from the model itself during training. A limitation is that the token k for the ground-truth answer is used as the target at step k, which might not always be the optimal strategy. There are also approaches that aim to approximate the gradient of the expected score. One such approach is â Direct Loss Minimizationâ (Hazan et al., 2010) in which the inference procedure is adapted to take both the model likelihood and task-speciï c score into account. Another popular approach is to replace the domain over which the task score expectation is deï ned with a small subset of it, as is done in Minimum (Bayes) Risk Training (Goel Byrne, 2000; Shen et al., 2015; Och, 2003). This small subset is typically an n-best list or a sample (like in REINFORCE) that may or may not include the ground-truth as well. None of these methods provide intermediate targets for the actor during training, and Shen et al. (2015) report that as many as 100 samples were required for the best results. Another recently proposed method is to optimize a global sequence cost with respect to the selection and pruning behavior of the beam search procedure itself (Wiseman Rush, 2016). This method follows the more general strategy called â learning as search optimizationâ (DaumÂ e III Marcu, 2005).

In addition, we performed an ablation study. We found that using a target network was crucial; while the joint actor-critic training was still progressing with Î3Î 0.1, with Î3Î 1.0 it did not work at all.
